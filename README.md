# Transmonpy
This repository will be used to hold all python code relevant to work on coupled Transmon simulations.

# Two transmon simulation
# using more realistic parameters:

J=2*np.pi*0.015 #could be made bigger eventually
nu=2*np.pi*4 #change Energies so this is the resonator's
delta=2*np.pi*0.1 #change Energies so this is really the detuning
de=-1*delta
wq=2*np.pi*5
EJ=2*np.pi*12
eta=.1
phiq=0.43
phia=0.019
ct=-2*np.pi/18.5 #check what the new cancellation tone is with the new numbers
